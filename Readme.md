Car Price Prediction Web App
Welcome to the Car Price Prediction Web App! ðŸš—ðŸ’°

This is a simple web application designed to predict the price of a used car based on its features such as the car name, company, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, and fuel type. The app is powered by a machine learning model that has been trained to make accurate predictions about car prices, making it easier for you to estimate the value of a car before buying or selling.

Features:
Car Name: Choose the car model you are interested in.
Company: Select the carâ€™s manufacturer (automatically suggested based on the car name).
Year: Enter the year the car was manufactured.
Kilometers Driven: Input the total kilometers driven by the car.
Fuel Type: Choose from petrol, diesel, or LPG.
Once you fill out the form and hit "Predict Price", the app will show you the predicted price of the car.

How It Works:
Model Training: The car price prediction model was trained on a dataset containing various car features (car name, company, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type) to predict the car's price.
Input Data: When you fill out the form, the input data is processed and passed into the trained model.
Prediction: The model processes the input data and returns a predicted price, which is then displayed on the webpage.
Demo:
To see the app in action, simply visit the homepage and enter the details of the car you're interested in. The app will predict the price based on the data provided.

Features:
Easy-to-use web interface to input car data.
Accurate price prediction for different car models and manufacturers.
Simple error handling to ensure that you get a clear message in case something goes wrong.

Technologies Used:
Flask: Web framework for building the web application.
Python: Programming language used for the model and backend.
Pandas: Data manipulation library used for processing input data.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for the price prediction model.
HTML/CSS: Front-end technologies for the user interface.
